My Kanban- Arnon Asquira
--Getting Started--
When I began working on my project, I first wanted to get a general feel of the application. i began working on alt+1/2/3 function, ading a task, and editing.
After i had a basic functioning app, i began wrapping my head around the localStorage idea. i haven't experimented with it before, so i had a bit of a learning curve,
but after a lot ofresearching i managed to update and load the localStorage. i came to the conclusion that the best idea, is to save and insert the entire lists using outerHTML.
This enables dynamic changing of what's going on in the DOM. A this point i still haven't faced the tests.

--Testing my App--
after I had a well functioning App which utilised the localStorage, i began working on the tests. I understood that the tests expect the tasks to be saved as a text.
This idea was very different from my original approach, so I created a new brench to try to tackle the tests with a cmopletely new approach.
I transformed my code, and after some trial and error I managed to pass the intial 6 tests

--Api integration--
My original brench already had a functioning API usage, when i started working on the Second brench's API tests. This part was very frustrating, i set hours trying to understand the tests,
and why they wern't passign, i consulted different students, but only after alot of different attempts i finally managed to pass the last test.
However, whenever I got stuck I always tried to make new features and improve my existing main brench. 
In the En i came out with two branches-
* A main brench which has extra features and improved designs, that also works perfectly fine, but which does not pass the test
* a second branch for passing the tests, whose code and APP are alot less pretty.

To sum up, this project was quite an experience, I worked on it for many hours and learned a lot.
however i am sorry about the time i spent redoing my code and attempting to pass the tests.
