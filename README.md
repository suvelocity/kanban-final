# Welcome to Cyber4s 3rd Pre-Course Final Project of Maor Kurztag

## Here will be details about the project and the code
In the code I built a site called "Tasks manager" which is meant to be used for the user as a task board that includes columns for tasks he/she did in the past, do in the present and will do in the future.

You can add tasks to any column at any stage, if the task status changes (you have done it or are currently performing, you can move it to another column by pressing the alt + button
1 whether to move to column "To-do tasks",
2 whether to move to column "In-progress tasks",
3 whether to move to column "Done tasks".
4 whether to delete the task.

The information will be saved at every stage in local storage, even after the page is refreshed.

You can search for certain tasks using the search bar, then the situation will return to normal and no task will be deleted.

You can use external API in order to save and load data.

All tasks can be deleted by clicking the "Clear all" button, the tasks will also be deleted from local storage
