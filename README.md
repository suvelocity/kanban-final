Welcome!

this is my Task Manager. Task Manager is a web page brought to you by me.
so without further ado... this is how the webpage looks like:

in this screen shot you can see i added some tasks for example.
the features included in this website are:
1. you can add new tasks by writing the task in the input and pressing the add button:

2. you can re-edit a task by double clicking the task you want to add.

3. you can move tasks from one list to another by clicking the wanted task and then pressing "alt+ number"
the number should be 1,2 or 3 depending on the list you want to be the destination.

4. a global search bar that shows you only the tasks that includes the characters written inside the input.

5. a current clean looking design that makes the site readable for long term usage. using cool tones to give a feeling of relief. in addition, while hovering over the lists you get a shadow affect.
