## Kanban's Interactions

 - [x] _Search bar_ ‚Äì Can search through tasks, case-insensitive. Start searching by every key pressed down. 

    **NOTE!** Every change in the page will always display tasks according to search input. For example, search input would contain "t", if you will add a task that does not include "t", the task will not be displayed (Will be added but not displayed)  

 - [x] _Add task_ ‚Äì Every section as an input with an "Add task" button. To add task, insert your task in the right input and press on "Add task". **NOTE!** Empty task is not allowed.

 - [x] _Edit task_ ‚Äì To edit a task, Double Click on the task, change the text inside and then press anywhere else on the screen, this would save the task. **NOTE!** Empty task is not allowed.

 - [x] _Drag and drop tasks_ ‚Äì To change the location of a task, drag the task to the wanted section and drop where the color turns blue. Also you cant change the place of the task inside the section the same way.

 - [x] _Move task with key combo_ ‚Äì To change task's section, do `Alt + number`. Move a task to "To-do" press `Alt+1`, Move task to "In-progress" press `Alt+2` and Move task to "Done" press `Alt+3`. The Moved task will always be displayed at the top of the section.

 - [x] _Delete task_ ‚Äì To delete a task, right click on the task and choose "Delete task", confirm the delete at the top of the page, and the task will be deleted. Another way to delete a task is to press ` ‚Üê backspace` on a selected task. After confirmation, the task will be deleted. 

 - [x] _Save button_ ‚Äì The save button will save the current tasks on a server which allows to load the information from any other computer.
